# L1G-2-L1T
Image-to-image geo-registration to translate Landsat MSS L1G images to L1T images.

##### Working 6/14/16

Still needs good documentation. Load the l1g-2-l1t_r_scripts.r file into RStudio and source it. Then open the l1g-2-l1t_r_run.r, which includes some directions. The l1g-2-l1t_tie_point_selector.html file must be copied to the output directory defined in the *run.r file and opened from there - it will hook up to a js file there.

Example of the JavaScript-based geo-registration initialization app: http://jdbcode.github.io/L1G-2-L1T/
