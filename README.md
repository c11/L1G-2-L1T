# L1G-2-L1T
Image-to-image geo-registration to translate Landsat MSS L1G images to L1T images.

#Working 6/14/16 - still needs good documentation. Load the l1g-2-l1t_r_scripts.r file into RStudio and then open the l1g-2-l1t_r_run.r, which includes some direction. The l1g-2-l1t_tie_point_selector.html must be copied to the output directory defined in the *run.r file and open from there - it will hook up to a js file there.
